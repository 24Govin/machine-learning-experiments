# ü§ñ Interactive Machine Learning Experiments

## TL;DR

Hey readers!

I've open-sourced a new [**ü§ñ Interactive Machine Learning Experiments**](https://github.com/trekhleb/machine-learning-experiments) project on GitHub. Each experiment consists of üèãÔ∏è _Jupyter/Colab notebook_ (to see how a model was trained) and üé® _demo page_ (to see a model in action right in your browser). Most of the models in these experiments were trained using _TensorFlow 2_ with _Keras_ support.

Although the models may be a little dumb (remember, these are just experiments, not a production ready code), they will try to do their best to:

- Recognize digits or sketches you draw in your browser
- Play with you in Rock-Paper-Scissors game
- Detect and recognize the objects you'll show to your camera
- Classify your uploaded image
- Write a Shakespeare poem with you
- etc.
