# 🤖 Interactive Machine Learning Experiments

## TL;DR

Hey readers!

I've open-sourced a new [**🤖 Interactive Machine Learning Experiments**](https://github.com/trekhleb/machine-learning-experiments) project on GitHub. Each experiment consists of 🏋️ _Jupyter/Colab notebook_ (to see how a model was trained) and 🎨 _demo page_ (to see a model in action right in your browser). 

Although the models may be a little dumb (remember, these are just experiments, not a production ready code), they will try to do their best to:

- 🖌 Recognize digits or sketches you draw in your browser
- 📸 Detect and recognize the objects you'll show to your camera
- 🌅 Classify your uploaded image
- 📝 Write a Shakespeare poem with you
- ✊🖐✌️ Play with you in Rock-Paper-Scissors game
- etc. 

I've trained the models on _Python_ using _TensorFlow 2_ with _Keras_ support  and then consumed them for a demo in a browser using _React_ and _JavaScript_ version of _Tensorflow_.

## Models performance

⚠️ First, let's set our expectations.️ The repository contains machine learning **experiments** and **not** a production ready, reusable, optimised and fine-tuned code and models. This is rather a sandbox or a playground for learning and trying different machine learning approaches, algorithms and data-sets. Models might not perform well and there is a place for overfitting/underfitting.

Therefore, sometimes you might see things like this:

But be patient, sometimes the model might get smarter 🤓 and give you this:
