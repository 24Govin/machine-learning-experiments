# 🤖 Interactive Machine Learning Experiments

## TL;DR

Hey readers! I've open-sourced a new [**🤖 Interactive Machine Learning Experiments**](https://github.com/trekhleb/machine-learning-experiments) project on GitHub. Each experiment consists of 🏋️ _Jupyter/Colab notebook_ (to see how a model was trained) and 🎨 _demo page_ (to see a model in action right in your browser). Most of the models in these experiments were trained using _TensorFlow 2_ with _Keras_ support.
