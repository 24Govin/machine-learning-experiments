# 🏋🏻‍ I've trained Recurrent Neural Network to generate recipes, and it suggested me to cook 🥤 Cream Soda with 🧅 Onions

## TL;DR

I've trained Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) on _~100k_ recipes using [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/). Here is what I ended up with:

- 🏋🏻‍ [Model training process](https://github.com/trekhleb/machine-learning-experiments/blob/master/experiments/recipe_generation_rnn/recipe_generation_rnn.ipynb)

This article contains details of model training with TensorFlow code examples (Python).
