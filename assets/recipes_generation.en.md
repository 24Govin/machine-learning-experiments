# A step-by-step guide on how to generate recipes using TensorFlow and Recurrent Neural Network

## TL;DR

I've trained Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) on _~100k_ recipes using [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/). Here is what I ended up with:

- üé® [Recipes generator demo](https://trekhleb.github.io/machine-learning-experiments/#/experiments/RecipeGenerationRNN)
- üèãüèª‚Äç [Model training process](https://github.com/trekhleb/machine-learning-experiments/blob/master/experiments/recipe_generation_rnn/recipe_generation_rnn.ipynb)

This article contains details of model training with TensorFlow code examples (Python).

## Experiment overview

I'm a complete beginner in Machine Learning üë∂üèª. Creating a _Recipe Generator_ was yet another attempt to play around with _Recurrent Neural Networks_ in my [ü§ñ Interactive Machine Learning Experiments](https://github.com/trekhleb/machine-learning-experiments) repository and to learn how those RNNs are implemented in TensorFlow in particular.

I was curious to see:

- what weird recipes names and ingredients combination the RNN would suggest
- will it learn that each recipe consists of several blocks (name, ingredients, cooking instructions)
- will it learn English grammar and punctuation from scratch just for several hours of training (I wish I had this skill)

I decided to experiment with **character-based RNN** this time. It means that I will not teach my RNN to understand words and sentences but rather to understand letters and theirs sequences.




In this experiment we will use character-based [Recurrent Neural Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network) (RNN) to generate cooking recipes. We will try to teach our RNN to generate recipe _name_, _ingredients_ and _cooking instructions_ for us.

I don't expect the RNN to do a strong connection between list of ingredients and cooking instructions but I do expect RNN to learn English grammar and punctuation in couple of hours and to generate some meaningful recipe names along with real food ingredients and cooking instructions.

For this experiment we will use [Tensorflow v2](https://www.tensorflow.org/) with its [Keras API](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras).

‚ö†Ô∏è _The recipes in this notebook are generated just for fun and for learning purposes. The recipes are **not** for actual cooking!_

## Exploring datasets

Let's go through several available dataset and explore their pros and cons. One of the requirement I want the dataset to meet is that it should have not only a list of ingredients but also a cooking instruction. I also want it to have a measures and quantities of each ingredient.

- ü§∑ [Recipe Ingredients Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/recipe-ingredients-dataset/home) _(doesn't have ingredients proportions)_
- ü§∑ [Recipe1M+](http://pic2recipe.csail.mit.edu/) _(requires registration to download)_
- ü§∑ [Epicurious - Recipes with Rating and Nutrition](https://www.kaggle.com/hugodarwood/epirecipes?select=full_format_recipes.json) _(~20k recipes only, it would be nice to find more)_
- üëçüèª [**Recipe box**](https://eightportions.com/datasets/Recipes/) _(~125,000 recipes with ingredients proportions, good)_

## Importing dependencies

@TODO: Explain why do we need these dependencies.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import platform
import time
import pathlib
import os
import json
import zipfile
```

```python
print('Python version:', platform.python_version())
print('Tensorflow version:', tf.__version__)
print('Keras version:', tf.keras.__version__)
```

```
Python version: 3.7.6
Tensorflow version: 2.1.0
Keras version: 2.2.4-tf
```

## Loading the dataset

Let's load the dataset using [tf.keras.utils.get_file](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/utils/get_file). Using `get_file()` utility is convenient because it handles caching for you out of the box. It means that you will download the dataset files only once and then even if you launch the same code block once again it will use cache and the download code will be executed faster.

```python
# Create cache folder.
cache_dir = './tmp'
pathlib.Path(cache_dir).mkdir(exist_ok=True)
```

```python
# Download and unpack the dataset.
dataset_file_name = 'recipes_raw.zip'
dataset_file_origin = 'https://storage.googleapis.com/recipe-box/recipes_raw.zip'

dataset_file_path = tf.keras.utils.get_file(
    fname=dataset_file_name,
    origin=dataset_file_origin,
    cache_dir=cache_dir,
    extract=True,
    archive_format='zip'
)

print(dataset_file_path)
```

```
./tmp/datasets/recipes_raw.zip
```

```bash
!ls -la ./tmp/datasets/
```
