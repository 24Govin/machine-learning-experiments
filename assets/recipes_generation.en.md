# üèãüèª‚Äç I've trained Recurrent Neural Network to generate recipes, and it suggested me to cook ü•§ Cream Soda with üßÖ Onions

# A step-by-step guide on how to generate recipes using TensorFlow and Recurrent Neural Network

## TL;DR

I've trained Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) on _~100k_ recipes using [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/). Here is what I ended up with:

- üé® [Recipes generator demo](https://trekhleb.github.io/machine-learning-experiments/#/experiments/RecipeGenerationRNN)
- üèãüèª‚Äç [Model training process](https://github.com/trekhleb/machine-learning-experiments/blob/master/experiments/recipe_generation_rnn/recipe_generation_rnn.ipynb)

This article contains details of model training with TensorFlow code examples (Python).

## Experiment overview

I'm a complete beginner in Machine Learning üë∂üèª. Creating a _Recipe Generator_ was yet another attempt to play around with _Recurrent Neural Networks_ in my [ü§ñ Interactive Machine Learning Experiments](https://github.com/trekhleb/machine-learning-experiments) repository and to learn how those RNNs are implemented in TensorFlow in particular.

I was curious to see:

- what weird recipes names and ingredients combination the RNN would suggest
- will it learn that each recipe consists of several blocks (name, ingredients, cooking instructions)
- will it learn English grammar and punctuation from scratch just for several hours of training (I wish I had this skill)

I decided to experiment with **character-based RNN** this time. It means that I will not teach my RNN to understand words and sentences but rather to understand letters and theirs sequences.




In this experiment we will use character-based [Recurrent Neural Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network) (RNN) to generate cooking recipes. We will try to teach our RNN to generate recipe _name_, _ingredients_ and _cooking instructions_ for us.

I don't expect the RNN to do a strong connection between list of ingredients and cooking instructions but I do expect RNN to learn English grammar and punctuation in couple of hours and to generate some meaningful recipe names along with real food ingredients and cooking instructions.

For this experiment we will use [Tensorflow v2](https://www.tensorflow.org/) with its [Keras API](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras).

‚ö†Ô∏è _The recipes in this notebook are generated just for fun and for learning purposes. The recipes are **not** for actual cooking!_

## Exploring datasets

Let's go through several available dataset and explore their pros and cons. One of the requirement I want the dataset to meet is that it should have not only a list of ingredients but also a cooking instruction. I also want it to have a measures and quantities of each ingredient.

- ü§∑ [Recipe Ingredients Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/recipe-ingredients-dataset/home) _(doesn't have ingredients proportions)_
- ü§∑ [Recipe1M+](http://pic2recipe.csail.mit.edu/) _(requires registration to download)_
- ü§∑ [Epicurious - Recipes with Rating and Nutrition](https://www.kaggle.com/hugodarwood/epirecipes?select=full_format_recipes.json) _(~20k recipes only, it would be nice to find more)_
- üëçüèª [**Recipe box**](https://eightportions.com/datasets/Recipes/) _(~125,000 recipes with ingredients proportions, good)_

## Importing dependencies

@TODO: Explain why do we need these dependencies.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import platform
import time
import pathlib
import os
import json
import zipfile
```

```python
print('Python version:', platform.python_version())
print('Tensorflow version:', tf.__version__)
print('Keras version:', tf.keras.__version__)
```

```
Python version: 3.7.6
Tensorflow version: 2.1.0
Keras version: 2.2.4-tf
```

## Loading the dataset

Let's load the dataset using [tf.keras.utils.get_file](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/utils/get_file). Using `get_file()` utility is convenient because it handles caching for you out of the box. It means that you will download the dataset files only once and then even if you launch the same code block once again it will use cache and the download code will be executed faster.

```python
# Create cache folder.
cache_dir = './tmp'
pathlib.Path(cache_dir).mkdir(exist_ok=True)
```

```python
# Download and unpack the dataset.
dataset_file_name = 'recipes_raw.zip'
dataset_file_origin = 'https://storage.googleapis.com/recipe-box/recipes_raw.zip'

dataset_file_path = tf.keras.utils.get_file(
    fname=dataset_file_name,
    origin=dataset_file_origin,
    cache_dir=cache_dir,
    extract=True,
    archive_format='zip'
)

print(dataset_file_path)
```

```
./tmp/datasets/recipes_raw.zip
```

```bash
!ls -la ./tmp/datasets/
```

```
total 521128

-rw-r--r--  1 trekhleb  staff  93702755 May 20 06:46 recipes_raw_nosource_fn.json
```

As you may see, the dataset consists of 3 files. We need to merge information from those 3 files into one dataset later.

Let's download a datasets and preview examples from them.

```python
def load_dataset(silent=False):
    dataset_file_names = [
        'recipes_raw_nosource_ar.json',
        'recipes_raw_nosource_epi.json',
        'recipes_raw_nosource_fn.json',
    ]
    
    dataset = []

    for dataset_file_name in dataset_file_names:
        dataset_file_path = f'{cache_dir}/datasets/{dataset_file_name}'

        with open(dataset_file_path) as dataset_file:
            json_data_dict = json.load(dataset_file)
            json_data_list = list(json_data_dict.values())
            dict_keys = [key for key in json_data_list[0]]
            dict_keys.sort()
            dataset += json_data_list

            if silent == False:
                print(dataset_file_path)
                print('===========================================')
                print('Number of examples: ', len(json_data_list), '\n')
                print('Example object keys:\n', dict_keys, '\n')

                print('  instructions: ', json_data_list[0]['instructions'])
                print('\n\n')

    return dataset

## Preprocessing the dataset

### Filtering out incomplete examples

```python
# Filters out recipes which don't have either title or ingredients or instructions.
def recipe_validate_required_fields(recipe):
    required_keys = ['title', 'ingredients', 'instructions']
    
    if not recipe:
        return False
    
    for required_key in required_keys:
        if not recipe[required_key]:
            return False
        
        if type(recipe[required_key]) == list and len(recipe[required_key]) == 0:
            return False
    
    return True
```

```
dataset_validated = [recipe for recipe in dataset_raw if recipe_validate_required_fields(recipe)]

print('Dataset size BEFORE validation', len(dataset_raw))
print('Dataset size AFTER validation', len(dataset_validated))
print('Number of invalide recipes', len(dataset_raw) - len(dataset_validated))
```

```
Dataset size BEFORE validation 125164
Dataset size AFTER validation 122938
Number of invalide recipes 2226
```

### Converting recipes objects into strings

To help our RNN learn the structure of the text let's add 3 "landmarks" to it. We will use these unique "title", "ingredients" and "instruction" landmarks to separate a logic sections of each recipe.

```python
STOP_WORD_TITLE = 'üìó '
STOP_WORD_INGREDIENTS = '\nü•ï\n\n'
STOP_WORD_INSTRUCTIONS = '\nüìù\n\n'
```

```python
# Converts recipe object to string (sequence of characters) for later usage in RNN input.
def recipe_to_string(recipe):
    # This string is presented as a part of recipes so we need to clean it up.
    noize_string = 'ADVERTISEMENT'
    
    title = recipe['title']
    ingredients = recipe['ingredients']
    instructions = recipe['instructions'].split('\n')
    
    ingredients_string = ''
    for ingredient in ingredients:
        ingredient = ingredient.replace(noize_string, '')
        if ingredient:
            ingredients_string += f'‚Ä¢ {ingredient}\n'
    
    instructions_string = ''
    for instruction in instructions:
        instruction = instruction.replace(noize_string, '')
        if instruction:
            instructions_string += f'‚ñ™Ô∏é {instruction}\n'
    
    return f'{STOP_WORD_TITLE}{title}\n{STOP_WORD_INGREDIENTS}{ingredients_string}{STOP_WORD_INSTRUCTIONS}{instructions_string}'
```

```python
dataset_stringified = [recipe_to_string(recipe) for recipe in dataset_validated]

print('Stringified dataset size: ', len(dataset_stringified))
```

```
Stringified dataset size:  122938
```

```python
for recipe_index, recipe_string in enumerate(dataset_stringified[:10]):
    print('Recipe #{}\n---------'.format(recipe_index + 1))
    print(recipe_string)
    print('\n')
```

‚Ä¢ 2/3 cup finely chopped onion
‚Ä¢ 2 garlic cloves, minced
‚Ä¢ 1 Turkish bay leaf or 1/2 California bay leaf
‚Ä¢ 2 (3-inch) fresh rosemary sprigs
‚Ä¢ 1/2 teaspoon salt
‚Ä¢ 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
‚Ä¢ 1 tablespoon olive oil
‚Ä¢ 1 medium carrot, cut into 1/8-inch dice
‚Ä¢ 1 medium celery rib, cut into 1/8-inch dice
‚Ä¢ 1 (15- to 16-ounces) can small white beans, rinsed and drained
‚Ä¢ 1 1/2 cups chicken stock or low-sodium broth
‚Ä¢ 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
‚Ä¢ 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
‚Ä¢ 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh chervil (optional)
‚Ä¢ Garnish: fresh chervil sprigs

üìù

‚ñ™Ô∏é Cook haricots verts in a large pot of boiling salted water until just tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to a bowl of ice and cold water, then drain. Add edamame to boiling water and cook 4 minutes. Drain in a colander, then rinse under cold water. If using edamame in pods, shell them and discard pods. Cook onion, garlic, bay leaf, rosemary, salt, and pepper in oil in a 2- to 4-quart heavy saucepan over moderately low heat, stirring, until softened, about 3 minutes. Add carrot and celery and cook, stirring, until softened, about 3 minutes. Add white beans and stock and simmer, covered, stirring occasionally, 10 minutes. Add haricots verts and edamame and simmer, uncovered, until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes. Add butter, parsley, and chervil (if using) and stir gently until butter is melted. Discard bay leaf and rosemary sprigs.

### Filtering out large receipts

Recipes have different lengths. We need to have one hard-coded sequence length limit before feeding recipes sequences to RNN. We need to find out what recipe length will cover most of recipe use-cases and at the same time we want to keep it as small as possible for training performance.

```python
recipes_lengths = []
for recipe_text in dataset_stringified:
    recipes_lengths.append(len(recipe_text))
```

```python
plt.hist(recipes_lengths, bins=50)
plt.show()
```

```python
plt.hist(recipes_lengths, range=(0, 8000), bins=50)
plt.show()
```
